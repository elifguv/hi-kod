Hi-Kod Mobile Application Workshop

Week 3:
This is my first Flutter app, which I developed to understand the widget-based structure of Flutter. The app includes a simple user interface with a drawer, app bar, and floating action button to demonstrate various Flutter components.

Throughout this project, I became familiar with:
- Widget Structure
- State Management
- Custom Widgets

  
Week 5:
This is a simple Flutter application that provides a weekly schedule overview with randomly assigned tasks, a settings page, and a profile information page.

Through this project, I learned:
- Working with StatefulWidget
- Implementing navigation between screens
- Using Switch widgets to toggle settings

  
Week 6:
This is a simple To-Do List App built with Flutter and Provider for state management. It allows users to:
- View a list of tasks with descriptions and date ranges.
- Add new tasks with a name, description, start date, and end date.
- Swipe to delete tasks dynamically.
  
Through this project, I explored:
- Provider for state management.
- ListView.builder to dynamically generate UI elements.
- Card and ListTile for clean UI presentation.

  
Week 7:
This is a Flutter application that displays real-time weather forecasts for multiple cities using the WeatherAPI.

What I learned through this project:
- Fetching data from an API using http.
- Parsing JSON responses in Dart.
- Using FutureBuilder for handling asynchronous operations.
- Displaying data in a dynamic list.


Final Project: 
This Flutter application enables users to track climate-related issues in Turkey and share their personal actions to fight climate change. The app provides an informative platform where users can explore current climate problems, manage their profiles, and  engage with the community by sharing their individual efforts.

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- State Management: Utilized Provider to handle user actions and update the app's state.
- Navigation: Implemented navigation between different pages within the app.
- UI Design: Developed a user-friendly interface featuring forms, buttons, and switches to enhance interactivity.
- Custom Widgets: Built reusable widgets for forms, input fields, and lists.
